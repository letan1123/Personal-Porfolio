# Personal-Porfolio
Basic portfolio about myself, background info, projects and interests
Welcome to the my personal portfolio webpage.
This is where you can get to learn more about me professionally and personally wise including projects that I had my hands on to demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of software engineer programming languages and skills.
The portfolio was created by dividing the page into sections as scroll downs.
I built each portion from top to bottom by designing each feature separately.
